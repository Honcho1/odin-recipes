    <h3>A salsa chicken recipe</h3>
    <p>
      Use your favorite jar of salsa (or try homemade salsa) to give simple
      chicken breasts big flavor.

      This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this
      recipe a few years back, and it has become a household favorite. Depending
      on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. I usually serve it
      with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons taco seasoning mix</li>
      <li>1 cup salsa</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sour cream (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Sprinkle seasoning mix on
        both sides of chicken breasts; pour salsa on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender and juicy and the
        juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle chicken evenly with cheese. Continue baking until cheese is
        melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more. Top with sour cream and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
