        cup of the bean mixture over it. Layer a few tablespoons of salsa over
        this. Then, place another tortilla over the salsa, and add more of the
        bean mixture. Follow the beans with a big handful of cheese, spreading
        evenly. repeat layers, spreading the ingredients evenly over the
        tortillas. On the top layer, make sure to use lots of salsa and cheese!
