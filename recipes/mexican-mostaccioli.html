    <h1 class="recipe-heading">Ingredients</h1>
    <ul class="recipe-text">
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package mostaccioli pasta</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (24 ounce) jar picante sauce</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes with juice</li>
      <li>1 Â½ cups shredded Mexican-style cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="recipe-heading">Directions</h1>
    <ol class="recipe-text">
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook mostaccioli at
        a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes;
        drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until
        crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and
        discard any excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add picante sauce and stewed tomatoes to the ground beef; cook, stirring
        occasionally, until the tomatoes soften completely, about 10 minutes.
        Gently stir the cooked mostaccioli into the ground beef mixture. Add
        Mexican-style cheese; cook and stir until the cheese is melted, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
